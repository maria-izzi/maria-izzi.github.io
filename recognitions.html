As a leader of the nationally reaching non-profit Girls Computing League, Maria was given the opportunity to attend an exclusive event in May 2019. The STEM for Changemaking Summit, held in Detroit, Michigan, was an all-expense-paid trip co-hosted by Ashoka and General Motors. GirlsComputingLeague was one of twenty-five ventures selected from a pool of grant applicants, and Maria was selected to deliver pitches, meet the other young leaders, and brainstorm how to bring the idea of entrepreneurship and changemaking to her community.
