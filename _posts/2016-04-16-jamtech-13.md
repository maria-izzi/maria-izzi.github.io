Today I attended JamTech 13! I continued my game, of course, and I am almost done. I was so engaged in the game that I worked through lunch! Now, my character can collect fire and water pellets, and I am working on the scorecard. I want to add new features, and I don't think I'll ever be satisfied - I'll keep making it better and better. I never considered game development as a career for me, but I think I'll still enjoy it as a hobby. I will definitely be at JamTech again!

Another exciting thing happened today - the mentor that's been working with me and my project for the past three JamTechs recommended me to the CEO of MARi, which is a sponsor of JamTech. My mentor had worked at MARi and loved his time there, and after seeing my skills on the project, he thought I'd be of good value for the team. The CEO asked me to send in my resume and availabilities! I'm so excited, because I hadn't even thought about the prospect of being in the workplace, and I think MARi will be very enjoyable and I will get to contribute to a real project. I'm so grateful that JamTech has opened up so many opportunities for me!
