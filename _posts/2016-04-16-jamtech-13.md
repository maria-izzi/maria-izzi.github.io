Today I attended JamTech 13! I continued my game, of course, and I am almost done. I was so engaged in the game that I worked through lunch! Now, my character can collect fire and water pellets, and I am working on the scorecard. I want to add new features, and I don't think I'll ever be satisfied - I'll keep making it better and better. I never considered game development as a career for me, but I think I'll still enjoy it as a hobby. I will definitely be at JamTech again!
