The 2018 AI Summit, held by Girls Computing League, was a blast! These past two days have really given me insight into what the future of healthcare and even daily tasks holds, and how that future really isn't far away. The speakers were fantastic, and they really blew me away. Being a part of this organization opens up so many opportunities to interact with such accomplished role models, and they truly inspired a lot of the students.

As an officer of Girls Computing League, I also got to have personal conversations with many of the speakers at the event. Speaking with Delegate Kenneth Plum stood out to me, because as a student of primarily STEM, I don't often think of my topics from a political standpoint, and I was able to gain a fresh perspecive. I also got to talk to Felicia Usher, the principal of Weyanoke ES, where I will be holding an after school coding club. I was even able to reconnect with some ladies from the DC Housing Authority who had been involved in the coding camps!

I absolutely loved leading the Alexa skill building workshop! Leading people through front and back end development and watching their eyes light up when they resolved an issue they'd been struggling with was an extraordinary experience. I also had a great time announcing the winners of the Ideathon, which is a notable feature of the AI Summit. Having awards specially reserved for females was a new concept, and it really brought to light some of the most innovative and ingenius ideas.
