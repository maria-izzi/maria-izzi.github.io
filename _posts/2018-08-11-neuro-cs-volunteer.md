Today, I had the experience of leading a workshop at a library catered towards teaching young girls about neuroscience and computers and the integration between them. We taught them both aspects of neuroscience, such as parts of the brain and parts of a neuron, as well as computer science in the form of Scratch programming. There was even a challenge to use Scratch to imitate solving a real world problem, and some of the ideas were incredibly creative and advanced! At the end, we played Jeopardy and had fun giving out prizes to winners of the competition. Many of the girls told us later that they felt inspired to continue solving problems using computer science! Thanks to NCWIT AspireIT for helping sponsor us financially!

Huge thanks to some volunteers for the pictures!
