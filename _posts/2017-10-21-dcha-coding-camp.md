Coming from TJHSST, where so many STEM opportunities are present and everyone is immersed in technology and science, its a comletely new concept to be in a place where kids, especially females, don't have that opportunity. Teaching girls to code at the DC Housing Authority was a really great experience, and I heard many things I never fathomed. We asked the girls questions like what their favorite subject was, and what they wanted to be when they grew up. A few girls said jobs related to fashion and makeup, and other jobs considered typically more feminine. When I asked them why, they said something like, "Oh because I'm a girl." That was insane to me to hear! After teaching them the basics of HTML and seeing the websites they created, I was shocked that kids with such talent could want to join jobs they may find uninteresting or meaningless, simply because of an illusion of a gender barrier. Girls aren't limited to the jobs they mentioned!

We got to really learn a lot about the girls, and they got to learn quite a bit about coding as well. People from such different backgrounds and interests came together in the community to create masterpieces.
