title: GM x Ashoka STEM for Changemaking Summit!
---

As a leader of the nationally reaching non-profit Girls Computing League, which helps level the playing field in technology fields for minorities, I was recently given the opportunity to attend an exciting event! The STEM for Changemaking Summit, held in Detroit, Michigan, was an all-expense-paid trip co-hosted by Ashoka and General Motors. I was one of twenty-five young changemakers selected from a pool of grant applicants, and I got to take a tour of the city, get to know the other changemakers, deliver pitches, and brainstorm how to bring the idea of entrepreneurship and changemaking to our communities. It was a great experience to learn from students like me from around the country, some of whom were closer than I thought! I even found that many other girls were a part of the NCWIT community! The interactive games and icebreakers made the group so close in such a short period of time - I was sad to say goodbye but grateful for the opportunity. Photos courtesy of Ashoka.
