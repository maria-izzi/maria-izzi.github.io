Today was my second JamTech, JamTech 12! A lot of kids started new games, but I wanted to continue working on my previous game. The same mentor came to help me when I got stuck with the code, and I got to make a lot of progress. I also met some new kids who had different experiences with computer science. We played each others games and helped each other out! I wanted to show my game at the showcase at the end, but I realized that I should develop the finished product and then display it. JamTech 12 was even better than JamTech 11!
