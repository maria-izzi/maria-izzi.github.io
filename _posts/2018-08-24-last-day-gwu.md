Today was a saddening last day at the Fu Lab in George Washington University's School of Medicine and Health Sciences. Spending an entire summer with my small but supportive group of lab members was a truly memorable experience. I got to apply biology and computer science concepts I'd been learning in theory! Interacting with adults who have so much experience in fields I hope to go into one day was inspirational to me. Not only did I contribute via my project, which will still continue into the school year, but I even embedded some computer science into my biological work! I will miss being the only high schooler in the room, and being teased about my inability to whistle, and I wouldn't trade this experience for the world!
