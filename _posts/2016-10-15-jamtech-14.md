Today was JamTech 14! After working at MARi, I have gained many computer science skills I can use. I met Mr. Carney again, and got to reconnect with some other members of the team. Hopefully next JamTech, I can be a mentor instead of a participant. I want to be able to spread my newfound knowledge and help other kids learn the same way I did! Going back to JamTech was very reminiscent for me as well, because of my memories with MARi. I saw many kids get excited about computer science just like I had, and the happiness it brought me was unmeasurable!
