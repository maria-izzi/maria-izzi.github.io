At the Children's Science Center, I taught an HTML coding workshop, with help of a friend! In addition to my presentation of the content to the students, they were able to begin building their own websites off of a template. There were so many creative ideas out there, and we even displayed them on the television! Some of the kids were in early elementary school, and it was absolutely amazing to see them code at the same level as many adults and older students. There were even some students who came in with prior experience in website development, and were prepared with loads of questions for me to sharpen their skills and gain mastery. All in all, it was an incredible experience, and I got to interact with young children as well as CSC staff to help these kids enjoy their time at the workshop.

Huge thanks to the parents for the pictures!
