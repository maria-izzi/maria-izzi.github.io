I had the amazing honor of being invited by May Casterline to attend NVIDIA's annual GPU Technology Conference in DC. I was one of four high school girls invited with Girls Computing League, as Ms. Casterline had spoken at our 2018 AI Summit, and NVIDIA had graciously sponsored Deep Learning Institute courses for around 300 students. I was inspired by incredibly successful women in the fields of computer science, who are currently doing what I hope to be doing in the future. I got to speak (impromptu) in front of all these incredible ladies and gentlemen about both my role in Girls Computing League and what my thoughts are on girls in STEM and female empowerment, as well as the power of having a network of support.

Huge thanks to the parents for the pictures and video of my speech!
