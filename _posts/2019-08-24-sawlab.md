This month, I had the wonderful experience of working at a recently formed lab at GWU, with Dr. Jimmy Saw. I loved working with Dr. Fu last year doing my own breast cancer research project, but I'm not sure wet laboratory work is for me. However, I still wanted to learn more about integrating biology and computer science together, and I wanted more experience with different types of research in a professional environment. I got a chance to work with metagenomic data from archaea living in extreme environments, and use different bioinformatics tools to analyze, manipulate, and transform the data. I've gotten a chance to expand my knowledge of archaea and my Python skills, as well as learn about Bash scripting and using the Linux terminal and various commands to automate actions. I'm looking forward to continuing work during the school year, and so far the results have been exciting and promising!
