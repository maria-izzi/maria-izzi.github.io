Being a part of the 2017 AI Summit was so much fun! Summits like these have been happening in the professional world, but never have I heard of one catered to kids! The speakers were so interesting and interactive. The only thing I didn't like was when it ended! I got to interact with the principal of my school, Dr. Ann Bonitatibus, and she is new to the school, just like me. Amidst introducing speakers and getting organized, there was a lot of work put into this event, but it all turned out great!

Huge thanks to the photographers for the pictures!
