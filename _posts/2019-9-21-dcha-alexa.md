This summer, I got a chance to expand my work with the DC Housing Authority via NCWIT, and lead my own program! I have worked with the DCHA for years now, but this was the first program I led alone, where I taught a group of about 30 girls how to build an Alexa skill from scratch, using Node.js and Amazon Developer. I had a blast, and it was so encouraging for me to have girls come up to me after the class was over and ask about how they can continue learning, and ask for my contact information to stay in touch. Even more exciting was that my partners at the DCHA wanted to start a monthly STEM program for both boys and girls, inspired by the girls' enthusiasm for the Alexa skill program, and I will be facilitating the monthly club. Getting to know the girls better and building connections with everyone at the DCHA has been unforgettable, and I'm so excited to go back every month!
