Today I attended an event called JamTech. It was a build-a-game-in-a-day event. I worked with Unity and C# to start working on a game where a person is running and has to collect coins. The mentors there were super helpful, and I got to have fun building a game with my friends. There was a showcase at the end, where I saw some really cool games. I had a blast!
