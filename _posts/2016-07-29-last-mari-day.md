My time at my summer volunteer internship at MARi is coming to a close. I've really enjoyed my time here, and I've gotten to learn a lot, not only about computer science, but also about collaboration in a workplace environment. Being one of the first student interns here has really meant a lot to me, and I greatly appreciate this opportunity! I worked hard to get here, and it really paid off. I especially enjoyed meeting the finalists of the Reach Higher Career App Challenge! Being around so many adults was overwhelming as the only middle schooler, but it was also very enriching and educational.
