<h3> Investigating the Effects of miR-409-5p on LRP8 in Breast Cancer Cells </h3>
<head>
Over the summer of 2018, Maria collaborated with Dr. Fu of the Fu Lab at George Washington University's School of Medicine and Health Sciences. She created a program to identify common target genes for a selected microRNA from different online identification tools. Then, she selected a specific marker gene that encodes proteins involved in metabolism of lysosomes. She grew breast cancer cell lines, with which she performed numerous tests to detemine the miRNA's impact on the target gene and cells, inluding quantitative real-time PCR, transfections, and MTT assays. The project won second place at the school's Science and Engineering Fair, and her research was published in the Teknos Science Journal.
