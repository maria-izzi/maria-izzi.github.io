<h3> Using Bioinformatics for Microbial Genomic Assembly</h3>
<head>
  This month, I had the wonderful experience of working at a recently formed lab at GWU, with Dr. Jimmy Saw. I loved working with Dr. Fu last year doing my own breast cancer research project, but I'm not sure wet laboratory work is for me. However, I still wanted to learn more about integrating biology and computer science together, and I wanted more experience with different types of research in a professional environment. I got a chance to work with metagenomic data from archaea living in extreme environments, and use different bioinformatics tools to analyze, manipulate, and transform the data. I've gotten a chance to expand my knowledge of archaea and my Python skills, as well as learn about Bash scripting and using the Linux terminal and various commands to automate actions. I'm looking forward to continuing work during the school year, and so far the results have been exciting and promising!

<h3> Investigating the Effects of miR-409-5p on LRP8 in Breast Cancer Cells </h3>
<head>
Over the summer of 2018, Maria collaborated with Dr. Fu of the Fu Lab at George Washington University's School of Medicine and Health Sciences. She created a program to identify common target genes for a selected microRNA from different online identification tools. Then, she selected a specific marker gene that encodes proteins involved in metabolism of lysosomes. She grew breast cancer cell lines, with which she performed numerous tests to detemine the miRNA's impact on the target gene and cells, inluding quantitative real-time PCR, transfections, and MTT assays. The project won second place at the school's Science and Engineering Fair, and her research was published in the Teknos Science Journal.
