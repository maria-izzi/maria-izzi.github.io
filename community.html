Maria has been a leader of the national DC-based, student-run nonprofit GirlsComputingLeague for five years, and she serves as the Chief Information Officer. She has organized and led summits in DC, and at universities like UVA and Harvard. Expanding the nonprofit both nationally and internationally, Maria organized an international hackathon where participants in one time zone would pass on the code to countries in another time zone after eight hours. Through this project, GirlsComputingLeague developed an artificial intelligence application that matches veterans with clinical trials, which was recognized in the AI Tech Sprint challenge held by the National Institute of Artificial Intelligence. You can find out more about that project <a href="https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/69832/national-artificial-intelligence-institute-ai-tech-sprint-veteran-focused-teams-recognized-national-challenge/">here</a> and <a href="https://wjla.com/features/good-morning-washington/girls-computing-league-develops-app-to-help-veterans-find-clinical-trials">here</a>. In DC, Maria worked to create an annual artificial intelligence summit in collaboration with Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, and other similar technology companies. She has utilized the organization's funds to create Title 1 school clubs for coding and technology, and hold local workshops with companies like Symantec and Accenture.

<h3> DC Housing Authority Workshops </h3>
<head>
  Through funding from NCWIT, Maria held an Alexa skill building workshop at the DC Housing Authority, a government initiative that assists low-income DC families with housing. She taught them how to build a skill from scratch, using AWS and Amazon Developer, and they modified these skills to educate the public about an issue they found prevalent in their community, ranging from police brutality to gender inequality to climate change. This event was featured in <a href = "https://www.dchousing.org/doc.aspx?docid=201909251229171192">this</a> article. After this event, Maria and the DCHA started a monthly, co-ed STEM club where students could learn engineering and science concepts through hands-on experiments and field trips. She is currently serving as a leader and facilitator of this club.

Since 2017, Maria has been teaching computer science classes to young students, primarily with HTML and CSS. She has taught at locations including the Children's Science Center and the DC Housing Authority. One similar event where she volunteered was featured <a href = "http://www.dchousing.org/doc.aspx?docid=2017110313131120320&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">here</a>.
