Maria has been a leader of the national DC-based, student-run nonprofit GirlsComputingLeague for five years, and she serves as the Chief Information Officer. She has organized and led summits in DC, and at universities like UVA and Harvard. Expanding the nonprofit both nationally and internationally, Maria organized an international hackathon where participants in one time zone would pass on the code to countries in another time zone after eight hours. Through this project, GirlsComputingLeague developed an artificial intelligence application that matches veterans with clinical trials, which was recognized in the AI Tech Sprint challenge held by the National Institute of Artificial Intelligence. You can find out more about that project <a href="https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/69832/national-artificial-intelligence-institute-ai-tech-sprint-veteran-focused-teams-recognized-national-challenge/">here</a> and <a href="https://wjla.com/features/good-morning-washington/girls-computing-league-develops-app-to-help-veterans-find-clinical-trials">here</a>. In DC, Maria worked to create an annual artificial intelligence summit in collaboration with Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, and other similar technology companies. She has utilized the organization's funds to create Title 1 school clubs for coding and technology, and hold local workshops with companies like Symantec and Accenture.
