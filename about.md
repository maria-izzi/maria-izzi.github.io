My name is Maria Izzi. I am a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence and other computer science related topics in my free time, as well as biology and its integration into computer science. I also enjoy reading John Grisham novels and playing the viola, and I am a first stand player in a local orchestra.
