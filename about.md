My name is Maria Izzi, and I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I enjoy learning about artificial intelligence and other computer science related topics in my free time, as well as biology and its integration into computer science. I am passionate about climate change and education, especially related to technology, and I also love reading John Grisham novels and playing the viola in a local orchestra.
